            <p class="font-weight">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>

            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>

            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q><p>

            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><strong>Maybe</strong></q><br></p >

        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.

        <h2>Here is this diaolog in the form of a table</h2>
        <table>
            <caption>Table representing the farmer's philosophy.</caption>

            <tr class="white">

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Good and <mark class="red">bad</mark> are just one perspective. Bananas are <mark class="good">good</mark> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <mark class="good">good</mark> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
